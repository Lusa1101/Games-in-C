Varsity Plug

This app is designed to help students connect and create opportunities within their own university. It brings together student entrepreneurs and potential buyers in a secure, exclusive marketplace. Think of it as an e-commerce platform, but only for students and staff at a particular university. Only members of the university—whether students or staff—are allowed to register and use the platform, ensuring a trusted community of buyers and sellers.

I am using the .NET MAUI framework to develop the application. The programming languages I have used include C# for the code-behind, SQL for creating and managing the database on the Microsoft SQL Server and Xamarin for the user interface.

The app is currently under development, and while the core framework is in place, many of the features are yet to be fine-tuned. As a result, some functionalities may not be fully operational at this stage.
